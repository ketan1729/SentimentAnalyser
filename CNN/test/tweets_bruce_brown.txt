"Denver Nuggets' best and worst 2-man lineups by net points per 100 possessions when those players are on the floor (minimum 200 minutes):

Nikola Jokić and Michael Porter (+14.7)

"@NBABlackburn when MPJ comes back I think a trade is in order soon or malone is gone this summer w Bruce + MPJ. 

Jokic/gordon/MPJ/KCP/Jamal

@DerekBodnerNBA Seems like the more natural two guard pairing would be Melton and Harden/ Shake and Maxey.  Melton the best defender of bunch and played that Bruce Brown role nicely. Shake can split ball handling with Maxey and allow him to play more off-ball.

Nah. Bruce Brown was there &amp; he’s from Dorchester. James Harden was there at one point &amp; since KD went to GSW after the free agency meeting then joined Kyrie he’s involved. After the 2020 playoffs there’s no going back. It’s a rivalry https://t.co/1GURtsJ9Jv

Bruce Brown gets the Nuggets on the board with an open 3 off some solid ball movement in New Orleans. Pelicans playing without Brandon Ingram and Herb Jones.
Im convinced Bruce Brown can easily average over 20 points as a starter. Hes so damn good.

@gsiener @RealCodyMallory It wasn't Bruce or anyone. The nets had bird rights to Bruce Brown. They could've signed him for however much. We had non-bird rights to Patty which let us sign him for 6m/year without having to use our TPMLE.

"(6) Team has to trade Kyrie. It's obvious he won't be back. So get something for him. Can't have a Dinwiddie/Bruce Brown situation where you let an asset walk. Make a deal, even if it's not the best deal and move on.

Lots of big offseason pick ups in the NBA but I think Bruce Brown is one that flew under the radar. The KCP trade worked out too.  Monte Morris going back to the Wizards worked for them as well

Patty Mills had a player option, so he was on the hook for $6M this year regardless.
