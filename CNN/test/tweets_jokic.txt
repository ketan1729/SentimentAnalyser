@tfracs Jokic is Jokic. I think he’d be himself. I guess you could call him a Point Center. Idk about the fit with Draymond because there’s some overlap there with the skill set. Defensively i think he protects Jokic so you kinda need him on the court
@NBABlackburn Best backup center we had in the Jokic era.
"@TheHoopCentral Jokic.  Yes I know, back to back MVPs.  But a lot of people still feel like he's overrated.  Denver would be a 30 win team without him.  They would have been a lottery team last year.  What he does every night is just insane."

"@NekiasNBA Appreciate the write up - there’s just no bona fide rim protection on this team rn, and they rly need a true backup center, esp with Nnaji being more of a 4 than 5 (and he’s not much of a rim protector anyway, even if he contests shots at the basket better than Jokic or Jordan)"
"So @LeBatardShow asks bball “expert” @DarthAmin how Giannis will be regarded &amp; he launches a 2000s Dirk xenophobia blah. People writing history Now—Simmons, Lowe, VGs—ain’t doing that. Jokic 2x MVP. Teams tanking for a French guy. Giannis won MVP! He’ll end up ~10th in pts ffs."

Or would the system have to be changed/tweaked a bit to have him play like an MVP. Or would Jokic have change to fit?

Let's discuss what would be done with him on offense and defense (which is not his strongest skill)"

"NBA PROP BET: NIKOLA JOKIC to record a TRIPLE-DOUBLE +270

Mavs rank last in the league on the boards this season, Denver 4th in the league in assists this season. Jokic assist from a triple-double last game vs. Pels. He gets it tonight."
"@EconomPic The West looks like a crap shoot, but on Sunday the Pels bench demolished the Nuggets bench. Jokic is a monster but they are going to need functioning reserves to win it."
Nekias breaks it down perfectly. Denver (in theory) should be good at screen navigation but for whatever reason they aren’t and that puts so much pressure on jokic and DAJ when they clearly are not built for it https://t.co/qplWUcio10

"Nuggets starting unit this year has  the highest net rating of starters in the Jokic era. Some of this is due to weak opposition: even after accounting for this, it’s still the best starting unit we’ve seen. 

So even with all the scheming issues, the starters aren’t the problem."

@jrichardgoodman draymond is one of the most versatile defenders. and most versatile in his generation. What did Jokic average vs dubs in the playoffs? that'll tell you all you need to know about him guarding skilled big men.
@njones1213 Luka and Jokic don’t play any defense so it’s gonna be an offensive game and Luka would win.

"@Justlove_drea @deadrick123 But that’s what I’m saying. You’d take the +4.5 as Cushion in case they lose a close game. Nuggets haven’t been great defensively Vs the Mavs who have. Also that nuggets squad cannot run that offense without Jokic. 
think Kidd has a plan for that. 
Luka vs Murray who scores?"
